####a. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
Easiest part was creating  mongoDB in heroku and rendering data from the database.

####b. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?  
I found displaying 20 data items difficult and took time for me. Deploying to heroku had many issues with the gem versions.

####c. If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
If i had to use these technologies in future, the major concern would be updates to ruby gems, we have to always update to latest version of gem or need to mention the version which we want to use to runn your project.
